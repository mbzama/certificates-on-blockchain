# Certificates on Blockchain


This POC is started in order to minimize background verification of students by verifying its details from University, College and student itself. It's a two-way verification of details that can help in bringing transperancy and tamper proof certificates.




## Blockchain Background


Before we talk about architecture of our POC, lets get some definitions out of the way first.



* **Blockchain** - A blockchain is a digital ledger that is shared with many different computers. When a transaction occurs, that event is recorded into the “blocks.” However, for the transactions to be successfully recorded into the ledger, they must be validated by a preset number of computers within the blockchain network.



* **Blocks** - Blocks contain transactions and a hash to verify integrity.



* **Transactions or Proposals** - These represent interactions to the blockchain ledger. A read or write request of the ledger is sent as a transaction/proposal.





## General Architecture

## Docker


To run the application using docker. Follow the instructions below to create a local Docker container:


   1. Clone this repository
   
          git clone https://github.com/mbzama/certificates-on-blockchain.git
          

   2. Start the container

          docker-compose up 
          

   3. To stop the container,

          docker-compose down 
          
   
   

   
## Running using npm


   1. Get the code:

          git clone https://github.com/mbzama/certificates-on-blockchain.git
          

   2. Change directory to ui:

          cd ui
          

   3. Install dependencies:

          npm install
          

   4. After succesfully installation of node modules, run the server:

          npm start
          
          
  
  
  
## Web UI (Screenshots)



 ### 1. For student login

 ### 2.For verification by student


   Below student data is confirmed by college and based on it student can verify information before submitting.

## Code Structure



This application has 3 coding environments.



* **Web UI Part** - This is angular 6 code and user interface interactions happen here:
                     
                     /ui/src/app
                     
                     
                     
* **Server Part** - This is JavaScript code running our application's backend. ie Node.js code. This code resides in:

                    /backend/app.js
                    
                    
                    
* **Blockchain Part** - This is ethereum project and all blockchain transactions happen here

                    /blockchain/app
